  <property>
    <name>hbase.regionserver.msginterval</name>
    <value>1000</value>
    <description>Interval between messages from the RegionServer to HMaster
    in milliseconds.  Default is 15. Set this value low if you want unit
    tests to be responsive.
    </description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.client.pause</name>
    <value>5000</value>
    <description>General client pause value.  Used mostly as value to wait
    before running a retry of a failed get, region lookup, etc.</description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.master.meta.thread.rescanfrequency</name>
    <value>10000</value>
    <description>How long the HMaster sleeps (in milliseconds) between scans of
    the root and meta tables.
    </description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.server.thread.wakefrequency</name>
    <value>1000</value>
    <description>Time to sleep in between searches for work (in milliseconds).
    Used as sleep interval by service threads such as META scanner and log roller.
    </description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.regionserver.handler.count</name>
    <value>5</value>
    <description>Count of RPC Server instances spun up on RegionServers
    Same property is used by the HMaster for count of master handlers.
    Default is 10.
    </description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.master.lease.period</name>
    <value>5000</value>
    <description>Length of time the master will wait before timing out a region
    server lease. Since region servers report in every second (see above), this
    value has been reduced so that the master will notice a dead region server
    sooner. The default is 30 seconds.
    </description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.master.lease.thread.wakefrequency</name>
    <value>2500</value>
    <description>The interval between checks for expired region server leases.
    This value has been reduced due to the other reduced values above so that
    the master will notice a dead region server sooner. The default is 15 seconds.
