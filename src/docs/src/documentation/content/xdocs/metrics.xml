        <title>HOWTO</title>
      <p>First read up on Hadoop <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/core/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/metrics/package-summary.html">metrics</a>.
      If you are using ganglia, the <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/GangliaMetrics">GangliaMetrics</a>
      wiki page is useful read.</p>
      <p>To have HBase emit metrics, edit <code>$HBASE_HOME/conf/hadoop-metrics.properties</code>
      and enable metric 'contexts' per plugin.  As of this writing, hadoop supports
      <strong>file</strong> and <strong>ganglia</strong> plugins.
      Yes, the hbase metrics files is named hadoop-metrics rather than
      <em>hbase-metrics</em> because currently at least the hadoop metrics system has the
      properties filename hardcoded. Per metrics <em>context</em>,
      comment out the NullContext and enable one or more plugins instead.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you enable the <em>hbase</em> context, on regionservers you'll see total requests since last
      metric emission, count of regions and storefiles as well as a count of memcache size.
      On the master, you'll see a count of the cluster's requests.
      </p>
      <p>
      Enabling the <em>rpc</em> context is good if you are interested in seeing
      metrics on each hbase rpc method invocation (counts and time taken).
      </p>
      <p>
      The <em>jvm</em> context is
      useful for long-term stats on running hbase jvms -- memory used, thread counts, etc.
      As of this writing, if more than one jvm is running emitting metrics, at least
      in ganglia, the stats are aggregated rather than reported per instance.
