    <title>HBase</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="white">
<a href="http://hbase.org">HBase</a> is a scalable, distributed database built on <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/core">Hadoop Core</a>.

<h2><a name="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Java 1.5.x, preferably from <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/">Sun</a>.
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/core/releases.html">Hadoop 0.18.x</a>.  This version of HBase will 
  only run on this version of Hadoop.
  </li>
  <li>
    ssh must be installed and sshd must be running to use Hadoop's
    scripts to manage remote Hadoop daemons.
  </li>
  <li>HBase currently is a file handle hog.  The usual default of
  1024 on *nix systems is insufficient if you are loading any significant
  amount of data into regionservers.  See the
  <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hbase/FAQ#6">FAQ: Why do I see "java.io.IOException...(Too many open files)" in my logs?</a>
  for how to up the limit.</li>
      <li>The clocks on cluster members should be in basic alignments.  Some skew is tolerable but
      wild skew can generate odd behaviors.  Run <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol">NTP</a>
      on your cluster, or an equivalent.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="getting_started" >Getting Started</a></h2>
<p>
What follows presumes you have obtained a copy of HBase and are installing
for the first time. If upgrading your
HBase instance, see <a href="#upgrading">Upgrading</a>.
</p>
<p>
Define <code>${HBASE_HOME}</code> to be the location of the root of your HBase installation, e.g. 
<code>/user/local/hbase</code>.  Edit <code>${HBASE_HOME}/conf/hbase-env.sh</code>.  In this file you can
set the heapsize for HBase, etc.  At a minimum, set <code>JAVA_HOME</code> to point at the root of
your Java installation.
</p>
<p>
If you are running a standalone operation, there should be nothing further to configure; proceed to
<a href=#runandconfirm>Running and Confirming Your Installation</a>.  If you are running a distributed 
operation, continue reading.
</p>

<h2><a name="distributed">Distributed Operation</a></h2>
<p>Distributed mode requires an instance of the Hadoop Distributed File System (DFS).
See the Hadoop <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/hadoop/api/overview-summary.html#overview_description">
requirements and instructions</a> for how to set up a DFS.</p> 

<h3><a name="pseudo-distrib">Pseudo-Distributed Operation</a></h3>
<p>A pseudo-distributed operation is simply a distributed operation run on a single host.  
Once you have confirmed your DFS setup, configuring HBase for use on one host requires modification of 
<code>${HBASE_HOME}/conf/hbase-site.xml</code>, which needs to be pointed at the running Hadoop DFS instance.  
Use <code>hbase-site.xml</code> to override the properties defined in 
<code>${HBASE_HOME}/conf/hbase-default.xml</code> (<code>hbase-default.xml</code> itself 
should never be modified).  At a minimum the <code>hbase.rootdir</code> property should be redefined 
in <code>hbase-site.xml</code> to point HBase at the Hadoop filesystem to use.  For example, adding the property 
below to your <code>hbase-site.xml</code> says that HBase should use the <code>/hbase</code> directory in the 
HDFS whose namenode is at port 9000 on your local machine:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;configuration&gt;
  ...
  &lt;property&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;hbase.rootdir&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;value&gt;hdfs://localhost:9000/hbase&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;The directory shared by region servers.
    &lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;/property&gt;
  ...
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre>

<h3><a name="fully-distrib">Fully-Distributed Operation</a></h3>
For running a fully-distributed operation on more than one host, the following configurations 
must be made <i>in addition</i> to those described in the 
<a href="#pseudo-distrib">pseudo-distributed operation</a> section above.  In 
<code>hbase-site.xml</code>, you must also configure <code>hbase.master</code> to the 
<code>host:port</code> pair on which the HMaster runs 
(<a href="http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-hadoop/Hbase/HbaseArchitecture">read about the HBase master, 
regionservers, etc</a>).  For example, adding the below to your <code>hbase-site.xml</code> says the 
master is up on port 60000 on the host example.org:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;configuration&gt;
  ...
  &lt;property&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;hbase.master&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;value&gt;example.org:60000&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;The host and port that the HBase master runs at.
    &lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;/property&gt;
  ...
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Keep in mind that for a fully-distributed operation, you may not want your <code>hbase.rootdir</code> 
to point to localhost (maybe, as in the configuration above, you will want to use 
<code>example.org</code>).  In addition to <code>hbase-site.xml</code>, a fully-distributed 
operation requires that you also modify <code>${HBASE_HOME}/conf/regionservers</code>.  
<code>regionserver</code> lists all the hosts running HRegionServers, one host per line  (This file 
in HBase is like the hadoop slaves file at <code>${HADOOP_HOME}/conf/slaves</code>).
</p>
<p>Of note, if you have made <i>HDFS client configuration</i> on your hadoop cluster, hbase will not
see this configuration unless you do one of the following:
<ul>
    <li>Add a pointer to your <code>HADOOP_CONF_DIR</code> to <code>CLASSPATH</code> in <code>hbase-env.sh</code></li>
    <li>Add a copy of <code>hadoop-site.xml</code> to <code>${HBASE_HOME}/conf</code>, or</li>
    <li>If only a small set of HDFS client configurations, add them to <code>hbase-site.xml</code></li>
</ul>
An example of such an HDFS client configuration is <code>dfs.replication</code>.  If for example,
you want to run with a replication factor of 5, hbase will create files with the default of 3 unless 
you do the above to make the configuration available to hbase.
</p>

<h2><a name="runandconfirm">Running and Confirming Your Installation</a></h2>
<p>If you are running in standalone, non-distributed mode, HBase by default uses
the local filesystem.</p>

<p>If you are running a distributed cluster you will need to start the Hadoop DFS daemons 
before starting HBase and stop the daemons after HBase has shut down.  Start and 
stop the Hadoop DFS daemons by running <code>${HADOOP_HOME}/bin/start-dfs.sh</code>.
You can ensure it started properly by testing the put and get of files into the Hadoop filesystem.
HBase does not normally use the mapreduce daemons.  These do not need to be started.</p>

<p>Start HBase with the following command:
</p>
<pre>
${HBASE_HOME}/bin/start-hbase.sh
</pre>
<p>
Once HBase has started, enter <code>${HBASE_HOME}/bin/hbase shell</code> to obtain a 
shell against HBase from which you can execute commands.  
Test your installation by creating, viewing, and dropping 
To stop HBase, exit the HBase shell and enter:
</p>
<pre>
${HBASE_HOME}/bin/stop-hbase.sh
</pre>
<p>
If you are running a distributed operation, be sure to wait until HBase has shut down completely 
before stopping the Hadoop daemons.
</p>
<p>
The default location for logs is <code>${HBASE_HOME}/logs</code>.
</p>
<p>HBase also puts up a UI listing vital attributes.  By default its deployed on the master host
at port 60010 (HBase regionservers listen on port 60020 by default and put up an informational
http server at 60030).</p>

<h2><a name="upgrading" >Upgrading</a></h2>
<p>After installing a new HBase on top of data written by a previous HBase version, before
starting your cluster, run the <code>${HBASE_DIR}/bin/hbase migrate</code> migration script.
It will make any adjustments to the filesystem data under <code>hbase.rootdir</code> necessary to run
the HBase version. It does not change your install unless you explicitly ask it to.
</p>

<h2><a name="client_example">Example API Usage</a></h2>
<p>Once you have a running HBase, you probably want a way to hook your application up to it. 
  If your application is in Java, then you should use the Java API. Here's an example of what 
  a simple client might look like.  This example assumes that you've created a table called
  "myTable" with a column family called "myColumnFamily".
</p>

<div style="background-color: #cccccc; padding: 2px">
<code><pre>
import java.io.IOException;
import org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.HTable;
import org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.Scanner;
import org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.BatchUpdate;
import org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.Cell;
import org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.RowResult;

public class MyClient {

  public static void main(String args[]) throws IOException {
    // You need a configuration object to tell the client where to connect.
    // But don't worry, the defaults are pulled from the local config file.
    HBaseConfiguration config = new HBaseConfiguration();

    // This instantiates an HTable object that connects you to the "myTable"
    // table. 
    HTable table = new HTable(config, "myTable");

    // To do any sort of update on a row, you use an instance of the BatchUpdate
    // class. A BatchUpdate takes a row and optionally a timestamp which your
    // updates will affect. 
    BatchUpdate batchUpdate = new BatchUpdate("myRow");

    // The BatchUpdate#put method takes a Text that describes what cell you want
    // to put a value into, and a byte array that is the value you want to 
    // store. Note that if you want to store strings, you have to getBytes() 
    // from the string for HBase to understand how to store it. (The same goes
    // for primitives like ints and longs and user-defined classes - you must 
    // find a way to reduce it to bytes.)
    batchUpdate.put("myColumnFamily:columnQualifier1", 
      "columnQualifier1 value!".getBytes());

    // Deletes are batch operations in HBase as well. 
    batchUpdate.delete("myColumnFamily:cellIWantDeleted");

    // Once you've done all the puts you want, you need to commit the results.
    // The HTable#commit method takes the BatchUpdate instance you've been 
    // building and pushes the batch of changes you made into HBase.
    table.commit(batchUpdate);

    // Now, to retrieve the data we just wrote. The values that come back are
    // Cell instances. A Cell is a combination of the value as a byte array and
    // the timestamp the value was stored with. If you happen to know that the 
    // value contained is a string and want an actual string, then you must 
    // convert it yourself.
    Cell cell = table.get("myRow", "myColumnFamily:columnQualifier1");
    String valueStr = new String(cell.getValue());
    
    // Sometimes, you won't know the row you're looking for. In this case, you
    // use a Scanner. This will give you cursor-like interface to the contents
    // of the table.
    Scanner scanner = 
      // we want to get back only "myColumnFamily:columnQualifier1" when we iterate
      table.getScanner(new String[]{"myColumnFamily:columnQualifier1"});
    
    
    // Scanners in HBase 0.2 return RowResult instances. A RowResult is like the
    // row key and the columns all wrapped up in a single interface. 
    // RowResult#getRow gives you the row key. RowResult also implements 
    // Map, so you can get to your column results easily. 
    
    // Now, for the actual iteration. One way is to use a while loop like so:
    RowResult rowResult = scanner.next();
    
    while(rowResult != null) {
      // print out the row we found and the columns we were looking for
      System.out.println("Found row: " + new String(rowResult.getRow()) + " with value: " +
       rowResult.get("myColumnFamily:columnQualifier1".getBytes()));
      
      rowResult = scanner.next();
    }
    
    // The other approach is to use a foreach loop. Scanners are iterable!
    for (RowResult result : scanner) {
      // print out the row we found and the columns we were looking for
      System.out.println("Found row: " + new String(result.getRow()) + " with value: " +
       result.get("myColumnFamily:columnQualifier1".getBytes()));
    }
    
    // Make sure you close your scanners when you are done!
    scanner.close();
  }
}
</pre></code>
</div>

<p>There are many other methods for putting data into and getting data out of 
  HBase, but these examples should get you started. See the HTable javadoc for
  more methods. Additionally, there are methods for managing tables in the 
  HBaseAdmin class.</p>

<p>If your client is NOT Java, then you should consider the Thrift or REST 
  libraries.</p>
