    <title>HBase</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="white">
<a href="http://hbase.org">HBase</a> is the <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/hadoop">Hadoop</a> simple database.

<h2><a name="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Java 1.5.x, preferably from <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/">Sun</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="getting_started" >Getting Started</a></h2>
<p>
What follows presumes you are installing HBase for the first time. If upgrading your
HBase instance, see <a href="#upgrading">Upgrading</a>.
</p>
<p>
Start by defining the following environment variables for your convenience:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><code>${HBASE_HOME}</code>: Set HBASE_HOME to the location of the HBase root: e.g. <code>/user/local/hbase</code>.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Edit <code>${HBASE_HOME}/conf/hbase-env.sh</code>.  In this file you can
set the heapsize for HBase, etc.  At a minimum, set <code>JAVA_HOME</code> to point at the root of
your Java installation.
<p>
If you are running a standalone operation, there should be nothing further to configure; proceed to
<a href=#runandconfirm>Running and Confirming Your Installation</a>.  If you are running a distributed
operation, continue reading.
</p>

<h2><a name="distributed" >Distributed Operation</a></h2>
<p>Distributed mode requires an instance of the Hadoop Distributed File System (DFS).
See the Hadoop <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/hadoop/api/overview-summary.html#overview_description">
requirements and instructions</a> for how to set up a DFS.</p> 
<p>Once you have confirmed your DFS setup, configuring HBase requires modification of the following two files:
<code>${HBASE_HOME}/conf/hbase-site.xml</code> and <code>${HBASE_HOME}/conf/regionservers</code>.  
The former needs to be pointed at the running Hadoop DFS instance.  The latter file lists
all the members of the HBase cluster.
</p>
<p>
Use <code>hbase-site.xml</code> to override the properties defined in 
<code>${HBASE_HOME}/conf/hbase-default.xml</code> (<code>hbase-default.xml</code> itself 
should never be modified).  At a minimum the <code>hbase.master</code> and the 
<code>hbase.rootdir</code> properties should be redefined 
in <code>hbase-site.xml</code> to configure the <code>host:port</code> pair on which the 
HMaster runs (<a href="http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-hadoop/Hbase/HbaseArchitecture">read about the 
HBase master, regionservers, etc</a>) and to point HBase at the Hadoop filesystem to use.  For
example, adding the below to your hbase-site.xml says the master is up on port 60000 on the host
example.org and that HBase should use the <code>/hbase</code> directory in the HDFS whose namenode
is at port 9000, again on example.org:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;configuration&gt;

  &lt;property&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;hbase.master&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;value&gt;example.org:60000&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;The host and port that the HBase master runs at.
    &lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;/property&gt;

  &lt;property&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;hbase.rootdir&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;value&gt;hdfs://example.org:9000/hbase&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;The directory shared by region servers.
    &lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;/property&gt;

&lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The <code>regionserver</code> file lists all the hosts running HRegionServers, one 
host per line  (This file is HBase synonym of the hadoop slaves file at 
<code>${HADOOP_HOME}/conf/slaves</code>).
</p>

<h2><a name="runandconfirm">Running and Confirming Your Installation</a></h2>
<p>If you are running in standalone, non-distributed mode, HBase by default uses
the local filesystem.</p>

<p>If you are running a distributed cluster you will need to start the Hadoop DFS daemons 
before starting HBase and stop the daemons after HBase has shut down.  Start and 
stop the Hadoop DFS daemons by running <code>${HADOOP_HOME}/bin/start-dfs.sh</code>.
Ensure it started properly by testing the put and get of files into the Hadoop filesystem.
HBase does not normally use the mapreduce daemons.  These do not need to be started.</p>

<p>Start HBase with the following command:
</p>
<pre>
${HBASE_HOME}/bin/start-hbase.sh
</pre>
<p>
Once HBase has started, enter <code>${HBASE_HOME}/bin/hbase shell</code> to obtain a 
shell against HBase from which you can execute HQL commands (HQL is a severe subset of SQL).  
In the HBase shell, type <code>help;</code> to see a list of supported HQL commands.  Note
that all commands in the HBase 
shell must end with <code>;</code>.  Test your installation by creating, viewing, and dropping 
a table, as per the help instructions.  Be patient with the <code>create</code> and 
<code>drop</code> operations as they may each take 10 seconds or more.  To stop HBase, exit the 
HBase shell and enter:
</p>
<pre>
${HBASE_HOME}/bin/stop-hbase.sh
</pre>
<p>
If you are running a distributed operation, be sure to wait until HBase has shut down completely 
before stopping the Hadoop daemons.
</p>
<p>
The default location for logs is <code>${HBASE_HOME}/logs</code>.
</p>
<p>HBase also puts up a UI listing vital attributes.  By default its deployed on the master host
at port 60010 (HBase regionservers listen on port 60020 by default and put up an informational
http server at 60030).</p>

<h2><a name="upgrading" >Upgrading</a></h2>
<p>After installing a new HBase on top of data written by a previous HBase version, before
starting your cluster, run the <code>${HBASE_DIR}/bin/hbase migrate</code> migration script.
It will make any adjustments to the filesystem data under <code>hbase.rootdir</code> necessary to run
the HBase version. It does not change your install unless you explicitly ask it to.
