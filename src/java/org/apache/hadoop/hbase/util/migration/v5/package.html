Package of classes used instantiating objects written with pre-version 5
versions of HBase.

Under the <code>hbase.rootdir</code>, a file named <code>hbase.version</code>
holds the version number for the data persisted by HBase.  The version number
is upped every time a change is made in HBase on-filesystem formats.  Version
0.2.0 of HBase shipped with an on-filesystem version of <code>5</code>.  This
package holds classes from previous to version 5 used during the migration of
an HBase instance up to version 5.  See
<a href="http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hbase/HowToMigrate">How To Migrate</a>
for more on the migration of HBase across versions and for notes on design
of the HBase migration system.
